## 📍 Overview
*SkillBridge* is designed to empower communities through microlearning. It connects learners and experts by enabling the creation and sharing of practical skill sessions (e.g., tailoring, coding basics, repair work) in a user-friendly web environment. The platform integrates real-time video conferencing and AI-powered tagging to facilitate smooth interactions and efficient search/discovery of skills.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase follows a modular architectural pattern with separate directories for background, components, and content. The code utilizes React for building the UI components. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.             |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The repository includes a README file that provides a basic overview of the project and its dependencies. The codebase itself lacks comprehensive documentation. The README could be improved to include detailed installation and usage instructions. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The codebase relies on various external libraries and packages such as React, uuid, esbuild, and eslint. It also includes packages for styling, UI components, and communication with external services. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The codebase is organized into separate directories and files for different functionalities, such as background, components, and content. This modular structure allows for easier maintenance and reusability of the code. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The codebase does not include any significant testing strategies or tools. This could be improved by implementing unit tests and using testing frameworks such as Jest or React Testing Library. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.       |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | The performance of the system would depend on factors such as the browser and hardware being used. However, the codebase does not appear to have any significant performance optimizations. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The codebase does not have explicit security measures. To enhance security, measures such as input validation, data encryption, and secure communication protocols would need to be implemented. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository utilizes Git for version control. It includes a GitHub Actions workflow file that automatically triggers a build and release process for the extension when a push event occurs. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The system interacts with the browser's APIs, such as the Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis API. It also interacts with external services through HTTP requests. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.|
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | The codebase does not appear to have specific scalability measures. To enhance scalability, the system could be designed to handle increased user load and data volume, utilize caching strategies, and employ cloud-based solutions. Limit your response to a maximum of 200 characters.           |
